          <p>My name is Nathan Hubner. Whether in the mountains or on the sea, I love adventure. Throughout my life I have been drawn to things that seem out of my reach. This is what really made me interested in developing. I have been using computers for a long time, and have always been intrigued at how websites work. As I have learned and grown, I have found a love for creating
            my own website and my own code.

          <h2 class="history-header"><u>Where I came from...</u></h2>
          <p>December 16th, 1995 was a day that went down in history for my family. This is the day that I was born. It all started at a hospital in downtown Salt Lake City. From there I mainly grew up around West Valley City. While living there I was able to attend the same schools that my parents did. It was always interesting seeing teachers remember who my parents were.
            I found that they often had stories to share.

          <h2 class="history-header"><u>Where I've been...</u></h2>
          <p>As I said before, I have have always been drawn to the call of adventure. From Seattle to St Louis, and from Illinois to Mexico. I have always loved getting out and meeting new people while exploring new cultures at the same time. Most of the time I was just visting for vacation, but I had the opportuinty to do 2 years of service in various parts of Missouri and Illinois.
            I loved getting to know the individuals and the culture there.

          <h2 class="history-header"><u>Where I plan on going...</u></h2>
          <p>Throughout the next 5 years I have a few places I would like to see myself. I would love to see my skills in developing reach a point where I can start my own company and help people create the websites and apps they would like to make. I would also like to se myself married with a family. As I have recently started developing I have thought heavily on what it will do for me and my family.
            I mostly it will show them that you can take anything you dream of doing and make it a reality.

          <h2 class="history-header"><u>Acheivements</u></h2>
          <p>The various acheivements I have in life range from acedemic to extra curricular, trivial to triumphant. I think the biggest achievement would have to be the fact that I have never given up on myself. In fact I have always been willing to push myself. Whether it was summiting a 10,000 ft peak, or survivng a slow day at work. I have always been willing to do what it takes to ensure I come off
            victorious.
